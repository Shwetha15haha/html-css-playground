        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Html?</h3>
      <!-- <h4>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h4>

      <p>
        HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.
        It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe
        the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="first-child-li">The opening tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web.Here are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="first-child-li">
          To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
        </li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here.</p>
