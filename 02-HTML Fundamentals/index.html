      All modern websites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.

      HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.
      It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe
      the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
      web.Here are 5 of them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
